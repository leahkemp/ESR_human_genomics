## What is this repo

This is a place to point to all the projects and analyses undertaken by the human genomics group at [ESR](https://www.esr.cri.nz/), as well as tools and software either developed internally, or those developed externally and used by the group. Each project will have one or more analyses, each analysis has a dedicated github repository (some public, some private). Each github repo outlines where to find the data, where the analysis was carried out, how to reproduce the analysis, information on accessing the github repository and more.

## General info

Minimal, cleaned up analyses can be found at either `/NGS/clinicalgenomics/archive/year/results/` or `/NGS/humangenomics/archive/year/results/` on ESR's production network. These include part of each analysis github repository (such as the `README.md` file) as well as minimal analysis results/outputs.

Most raw data will be found at `/NGS/clinicalgenomics/archive/year/run/raw/` or `/NGS/humangenomics/archive/year/run/raw/` on ESR's production network (with some data on `/mnt/cavia_porcellus/` on Leviathan on the research network). Here, more information about each project, metadata, sequencing information, information on getting the data to that location can be found.
